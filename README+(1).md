## BOOM bikes-assignment


A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
The company wants to know :

*     Which variables are significant in predicting the demands for shred bikes.
*     How well those variables describe the bike demands.



## Conclusions

Temperature stands out as the most influential factor positively impacting business.
Conversely, environmental conditions such as  humidity, wind speed,light rain and cloud cover have a negative effect on business.
